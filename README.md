Our goal is to develop a regression model to predict the vision range based on the various climate variables found in the training data and then test the model. In order to minimize the number of yearly traffic accidents caused by low vision, especially in foggy and wet weather, this initiative is being implemented. We have utilized the very epitome of predictive approaches, i.e. Deep Learning and Machine Learning models.
